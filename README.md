# bookmarks_frontend

Frontend for managing bookmarks (see [Bookmarks_backend](https://github.com/dreamer20/Bookmarks_backend)).

Created with [Vue3](https://github.com/vuejs/create-vue)+[vue-router](https://github.com/vuejs/router)+[pinia](https://github.com/vuejs/pinia)+[vuestic-ui](https://github.com/epicmaxco/vuestic-ui).

You can see it running at [GitHub Pages](https://dreamer20.github.io/bookmarks_frontend/) (due to Render plan restriction first load may take a while).

To test it you can register your own user or just use already registered user by username `test` and password `test1234`.
